decks:
  - name: CORE
    description: >
      The CORE deck contains all the "core rules" of the game:
      player agendas, character cards, conditions, and random oracles.

      This deck alone doesn't have specific flavor,
      but it can be used to build any game you want to play.
stacks:
  - name: Core Rules
    description: >
      Core Rules are cards that tell you how to play the game.
  - name: Agenda
    description: >
      Agenda cards tell players what they should do during the game.
      You should have at least one agenda card during play.

      If you aren't sure what other agenda you should have,
      the Principal is probably what you want.
  - name: &crisisstack Optional Rules (Crisis)
    description: >
      You can use crisis cards at different moments of the game
      to change the urgency or tension of a scene.

      Introducing a crisis card changes the rules of card draws and flips
      in special situations.
      The crisis card is discarded once the scene ends.

        During play, you can speak from one of several agendas.

        These agendas can be assigned individually to several people,
        or all given to a single player.

        The agendas can change hands during the game.
        You cannot take an agenda away from someone else,
        but you can ask someone else to give up an agenda.

        If you've been assigned an agenda, you are bound to speak from it.

        If anything makes anyone uncomfortable in any way,
        just lift this card up, or simply tap it. You don't have to explain why.
        It doesn't matter why.
        When we lift or tap this card, we simply edit out anything X-Carded."

        anyone can call for a break and we can talk privately.
        I know it sounds funny but it will help us play amazing games together

      rule: Flip for additional rules.
    front:
      <<: *whatif
      description: >
        When another player narrates a PC's action,
        such as "I attack the ogre",
        you can ask "what if...?"
        You must propose an interesting alternative outcome,
        such as "what if the ogre smashes you across the room?"

        If anyone else in the group accepts the What If,
        and no player vetoes it, the original player must
        get a Hit for their narration to prevail.
        They can also opt to accept the What If.

        What Ifs can pre-empt the action ("your attack doesn't land, the ogre hits you")
        or add to it ("your attack lands, and the ogre counters").
    back:
      <<: *whatif
      description: >
        Other players can suggest ways to build on the What If,
        or propose their own alternatives. Only one What If can prevail.

        Use What Ifs to make characters work overcome threats, or
        introduce complications to their actions. What Ifs can
        pre-empt the original action, or add an outcome after it finishes.

        What If...
      prompts:
        - A Condition card you took would interfere with your action?
        - The risks inherent in some difficult or complex action come into play?
        - A new danger appears, or an existing danger is escalated?
        - It seems dramatically appropriate for a thing to happen?
