decks:
  - name: CORE
    description: >
      The CORE deck contains all the "core rules" of the game:
      player agendas, character cards, conditions, and random oracles.

      This deck alone doesn't have specific flavor,
      but it can be used to build any game you want to play.
stacks:
  - name: Core Rules
    description: >
      Core Rules are cards that tell you how to play the game.
  - name: Core Rules (Agenda)
    description: >
      Agenda cards tell players what they should do during the game.
      You should have at least one agenda card during play.

      If you aren't sure what other agenda you should have,
      the Principal is probably what you want.
  - name: Core Rules (Crisis)
    description: >
      You can use crisis cards at different moments of the game
      to change the urgency or tension of a scene.

      Introducing a crisis card changes the rules of card draws and flips
      in special situations.
      The crisis card is discarded once the scene ends.

      description: >
        During play, you can speak from one of several agendas.

        These agendas can be assigned individually to several people,
        or all given to a single player.

        The agendas can change hands during the game.
        You cannot take an agenda away from someone else,
        but you can ask someone else to give up an agenda.

        If you've been assigned an agenda, you are bound to speak from it.

    front:
      <<: *challenges
      description: >
        Any player may challenge a PC's action if
        success or failure are both interesting.

        When your PC is challenged, you must generate a hit to meet it,
        like flipping a character card.
        If you don't meet a challenge,
        your PC's intentions are thwarted or complications arise.

        The challenge must suggest consequences for failure.
        "Or else nothing happens" is not a challenge.
        The same action cannot be challenged multiple times.
    back:
      <<: *challenges
      description: >
        Use challenges to tune the difficulty of a situation.

        - You're navigating rough terrain, and might fall or lose equipment
        - You're fighting or fleeing a dangerous monster

        Some situations will wreck a character's plans and assumptions,
        or be so daunting they have no idea how to handle it at first.

        such as defeating an enemy or finding shelter.
