      Focus cards tell us how your character gets things done in a story.
      A character like Han Solo has "Charm" as a focus,
      while Princess Leia has "Courage" and Luke Skywalker has "Instinct".

      The flip side of a focus is how its use can go wrong for a character.
      Courage can become recklessness. Technology can fail.
      Magic can exact a price. And so on.

        "It doesn't matter if I win. It matters if I don't try." -- Emory
      description: >
        Courage is strength in the face of grief, pain, and fear.

        Courage lets you fight when afraid, speak when being shouted down,
        stand up when you're injured, or rebuke someone you respect.

        - Honor or pride must be upheld
        - Someone or something near you has already suffered harm

        "Emory! Fall back! This isn't our fight!" -- Tana
      description: >
        Courage can twist into cowardice or recklessness.
        Not everyone knows the right time to run from a battle, or
        when a battle really needs to be fought.
        And not everyone is prepared to fight every battle they face.
      prompts:
        - Boast of deeds undone or make promises you can't fulfill

        "Listen, city boy. Stop talking or I'll cut your tongue out." -- Woody
      description: >
        Some people can become enraptured by their own ability to impress and influence.
        They buy into the story they're selling, until reality intrudes.

        Others see charm as deceit, and will trust you less.
      prompts:
        - Show off needlessly
        - Push things for the sake of pushing
        - Take advantage of someone's emotions

      description: >
        Your heart, your conscience, a divine command, or something else
        outweighs reason when you act.

        Instinct lets you act when everything says to hesitate,
        when uncertainty overwhelms you,
        or when speed counts more than reason.
      prompts:
        - Take decisive action now
        - Get an immediate read on a person or situation
        - Leap into an opportunity

      description: >
        The mystical, the eldritch, the arcane.
        The Power has many names. What do you call it?

        "The Power is much like the ocean. You can sail in it, or drown in it." -- Tana
      description: >

        "Basler, where did you get that knife from?" -- Tana
      description: >
        You deal in concealment, stealth, and subterfuge.
        Your tools are things people don't want known, or weren't expecting.
        You could use hidden weapons, court gossip,
        cloak-and-dagger skulduggery, or the secrets of the heart.
      prompts:
        - Acquire something from someone else without their knowledge
        - Reveal something you've been concealing
        - Avoid detection or culpability

        "You don't wanna know" -- Basler
      description: >
        The problem with secrets is keeping track of who knows what.
        The value of a secret is lost once it's revealed.
        And some secrets weigh on the conscience.

        "The gizmo broke and I gotta fix it. Well, at least I have my tools." -- Basler
      description: >
        Nothing works perfectly, especially new inventions
        that have seen more use than testing.
      prompts:
        - The gadget has unexpected side effects or fails to work at a key moment
        - A gadget malfunctions or breaks in interesting ways

        Through exercise, mindfulness, and practice,
        you've learned to use your own mind and body as a tool.

      description: >
        Your discipline is demanding,
        and while your body is versatile and powerful,
        it can't compete with everything.
      prompts:
        - Face a problem that requires tools after all
        - Spend time honing yourself instead of accomplishing an important goal
        - Reveal your abilities to someone you'd rather not see them

      description: >
        Wits lets you make the most of everything around you.

      description: >
        No battle plan survives contact with the enemy,
        but not all planners are humble enough to realize that.
        Getting by on the world can sometimes mean exploiting people,
        or seeming like you're doing so.
      prompts:
        - Misjudge the strength of your position
        - Overplay your hand
        - Make someone else pay for your victory
