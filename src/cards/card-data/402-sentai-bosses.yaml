      Special Moves are attacks or techniques that major monsters can use during battle.
      When the Special Move's front face is up, the move can be used against the heroes.
      The card is then flipped.

      When the card's back side is up, the Special Move is vulnerable to
      defeat. It can be sealed away, destroyed, countered, or otherwise rendered ineffective.
