      you take on a drawback or complication that will affect your future actions.

        You can take a condition to get a hit. Describe how.
        You can flip a front-side condition to worsen it and get a hit. Describe how.
        Players who challenge you can suggest conditions to meet it.

        The condition is fictionally true and limits your actions.
        Other players can pose a challenge if a condition would interfere with something you do.
        Discard any conditions that no longer apply in the fiction.

        Individual condition cards describe how to clear them.
