      An Emotion Oracle lets you pick one of the fundamental human emotions
      by drawing a card.
      Emotion Oracles don't work alone. Instead, they can flavor other things.
      Combine an Emotion with Encounter cards to suggest a dominant feeling
      the encounter should have.
      Combine an Emotion with a random Character card to create a personality,
      or an attitude toward that thing (for example, "Rage" and "Magic" together
      can represent someone angry at sorcery, or sorcerers).

        Oracle cards can answer questions. Draw one card for a simple answer, or two cards for a complex one.

        Use these cards to answer what someone is feeling, or what emotion a thing or event would spark.

        Each emotion has two neighbors. You can use the emotion itself, or choose to mix it with a neighbor.
