        "My daggers bounced off that plate mail! What now?" -- Basler
      description: >
        This encounter includes something important that is heavily defended.
        This could mean body armor of leather or metal,
        hardened barriers of stone, or wood,
        a protective aura of magic, a divine blessing,

      name: Armored
      flavor: >
        "You know what metal does? Heats up. Fireball!" -- Tana
      description: >
        Every armor has a weakness or comes at a cost,
        like making someone slower or something heavier.
        Not every armor's weakness is obvious, and finding it may be difficult.
      prompts:
        - Those protected have limited mobility and senses
        - Weakness to specific damage types, e.g. lightning
        - Useless if penetrated or lost

      name: Base
      flavor: >
        "That's a big castle..." -- Basler
      description: >
        A Base can be a temporary encampment, an outpost,
        a secret headquarters, a wild animal's den, or some other protected space.
        You might need to find something specific,
        get in or out, or confront the occupants.
      prompts:
        - Bases can have numerous occupants
        - Traps, labyrinthine structure, or other clever preparations

      flavor: >
        "The tyrant king doesn't know about these secret tunnels" -- Emory
      description: >
        While Bases can be big and imposing,
        their nature can work against their occupants.
        The bigger the Base, the more likely it is to hold something helpful.
      prompts:
        - Contain secrets about the plans and activities of its occupants
        - Hold resources, weapons, or captives

        "Back, foul fiend! Light will overcome you!" -- Emory
      description: >
        A Diabolical encounter has the touch of evil.
        An actual summoned demon, a possessed victim,
        or a dark and malevolent force are all Diabolic.
      prompts:
        - Seek to corrupt or influence the vulnerable
        - Exploit moral weaknesses or dark secrets
        - Expose its true nature and hellish powers

      name: Diabolical
      flavor: >
        "Basler, stop cringing. He's not talking about you." -- Woody
      description: >
        Evil hasn't won, though it keeps trying.
        Powers from beyond are bound by their own rules too,
        and can be defeated accordingly.

        Characters who arm themselves with occult lore or
        divine blessings may circumvent or neutralize
        a Diabolical power.
      prompts:
        - Be susceptible to folk incantations or rituals
        - Recoil from the pure of heart

      name: Elemental
      flavor: >
        "They had some nice gemstones too!" -- Basler
      description: >
        Each element has rules. Water flows.
        Fire burns, but not without fuel.
        Some elements can counteract others.
        These rules can be exploited.
      prompts:

      description: >
        This encounter includes something flying or airborne.
        Winged creatures, skilled magicians, and floating platforms

      prompts:
        - Become entangled, trapped, or confined in ways that negate flight
        - Be unable to lift heavy loads or fly under difficult conditions

        "Sounds like fair odds to me. Have at you!" -- Emory
      description: >

      description: >
        A Hybrid being is made up of two or more things, not always living.
        Such beings can be part-human (mermaids, harpies),

      flavor: >
        "The bigger they are, the harder they fall!" -- Tana
      description: >
        This encounter includes something of enormous size.

      description: >
        You may have trouble engaging with a Large encounter
        due to the size difference, but that trouble goes both ways.
        It can be hard for Large things to perceive or target smaller
        foes.

      name: Monstrous
      flavor: >
        "That ain't no ordinary wolf, folks.." -- Basler
      description: >
        Monstrous threats are altered forms of the familiar.
        They are fiercer, more feral, or disturbingly unnatural,
        the nightmarishly distorted vision of the original.

        - Lash out viciously
        - Use their adaptions to overwhelm the unprepared

      description: >

        An artifact of legend, replete with arcane power.
        A person sung of by the bards.
        The weight of its reputation or its followers may be as much of a danger as its own power.

        - Live up to the legend in a big way
        - Reveal an unexpected ability

      description: >
        The stories about this encounter might give you
        clues on how to deal with it. But stories are just that, stories.
        You might correctly leverage its lore,
        or look at it with fresh eyes and discover a truth the bards omitted.
      prompts:
        - Behave or react predictably
        - Be less, or other, than the stories say

        It both surprises characters, and prepares them for what is next.

      description: >
        Spectral beings are only visitors in the waking world.
        Their anchors are tenuous,

      prompts:
        - Be weakened or repulsed by warding rituals
        - Fall prey to their passions

      description: >
        Venomous creatures, assassins with poisoned blades, 
        swamp gasses, and many other things can afflict you

      description: >
        Some toxins have antidotes, or may not penetrate some

        For example, a snake's fangs might be deflected by armor.

        - Inadvertently harm allies, or themselves if they are not immune
        - Be unable to deliver its poison if you find adequate protection

      description: >
        Necromancy, curses, or strange phenomena
        can bring a deceased creature back to a false life.
        The being is sustained by magic, not biology.

        - Frighten onlookers with a reminder of mortality

      name: Undead
      flavor: >
        "Not so much fell as fell apart..." -- Basler
      description: >
        Being sustained by dark magic, the undead are equally vulnerable to it.
        Many cannot abide holy objects, places, or effects.
        Others are bound by orders to only guard a certain place,
        or do a certain thing.
      prompts:
        - Weaken or expire in the presence of the sacred or the pure
        - Fall prey to tricks or traps a thinking being could avoid
        - Have limitations its creator didn't anticipate
