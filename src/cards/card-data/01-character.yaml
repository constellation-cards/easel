      description: >
        To create a new PC, pick three cards: Focus, Role, and Origin.
        You can choose cards at random, or select them yourself.

        These cards describe the traits that you want to spotlight during the game.
        Just because someone else has the Courage card
        doesn't mean your character isn't courageous,
        only that it's not going to be the quality you're focusing on.
      prompts:
        - "Front: get a hit by flipping the card"
        - "Back: flip when a prompt is narrated by anyone"
    back: *characters
