      <<: *dynamic-front
      name: Artistic
      description: >
        Two neighborhoods are connected via artistic expression.
        One may house artists who draw inspiration or receive funding
        from the other. Artists of different traditions may cross-train,
        creating a new and unique tradition.
      prompts:
        - What forms of art exist in the city?
        - How does the city view those who make art?
        - Who is interested in collecting or commissioning art?

      name: Artistic
      description: >
        Two neighborhoods are connected via artistic expression.
        One's artists may be exploited by patrons from the other,
        or the artists are improperly borrowing from a neighboring culture.
        Two neighborhoods may have competing
        cultural and artistic traditions.
      prompts:
        - What forms of art exist in the city?
        - How does the city view those who make art?

      name: Criminal
      description: >
        Two neighborhoods are connected via criminal activity,
        from petty theft and pickpocketing to smuggling to murder.
        Organized crime cartels, thieves' guilds, etc. from one
        neighborhood may prey on the other. Or legitimate business
        in one is being propped up by criminal activity in the other.
      prompts:
        - What kinds of laws exist? Are they fair?
        - Who enforces those laws? How strictly?
        - How does the public view the criminal element?

        Two neighborhoods are connected via criminal activity,
        From petty theft and pickpocketing to smuggling to murder.
        Gang wars between rival factions, a single criminal mastermind,
        or open corruption are all possibilities.
      prompts:
        - What kinds of laws exist? Are they fair?
        - Who enforces those laws? How strictly?
        - How does the public view the criminal element?

      <<: *dynamic-front
      name: Commercial
      description: >
        People from one neighborhood buy or sell
        goods and services to the other.
        Advertising, word of mouth, or tradition might
        entice new visitors.
        Supply and demand are roughly balanced,
        or the market is adaptable enough to cope
        when they aren't.
      prompts:
        - Who pays whom, and for what?
        - Who benefits from the arrangement? Who suffers?
        - Who would like a piece of the action?
    back:
      <<: *dynamic-back
      name: Commercial
      description: >
        People from one neighborhood in the dynamic
        buy or sell goods and services to the other.
        Market prices are volatile, or there may be
        an imbalance in supply vs. demand.
      prompts:
        - Who gains from the instability? Who loses?
        - Where else can supply, demand, or labor be found instead?
        - How are people coping?

      description: >
        Two neighborhoods interact through arcane goods and services.
        One may supply the other's needs, or contain a natural source for something vital or valuable.
        Or both may contribute ingredients to complete a final thing.
      prompts:
        - What kinds of things are exchanged?
        - What kind of people work with them?
        - How does the city view such people?

      name: Esoteric
      description: >
        Two neighborhoods interact through arcane goods and services.
        Although one needs what the other has, the exchange
        is threatened by mistrust, scarcity, or the volatility of
        the materials and processes themselves.
      prompts:
        - What kinds of things are exchanged?
        - What kind of people work with them?
        - How does the city view such people?

      <<: *dynamic-front
      name: External
      description: >
        Two neighborhoods are connected by something happening outside the city.
        This could be immigration, trade, religious or political action,
        cultural trends, or something else.
      prompts:
        - What is the external?
        - Is the city importing or exporting it?
        - Who benefits? Who doesn't?
    back:

      name: External
      description: >

        shaken up by it.
      prompts:
        - What is the external?
        - Is the city importing or exporting it?
        - Who benefits? Who doesn't?

    front: &Industrial
      <<: *dynamic-front
      name: Industrial
      description: >
        Two neighborhoods are connected by the production of goods.
        One may supply workers and/or raw materials for the other,
        one may buy what the other makes,
        or the two may cooperate in other ways.
      prompts:
        - What is being made? Processed metals, medicines, tools?
        - How is it being used? By whom? For what?
        - Who wants these things? Who doesn't them to be made?
    back:
      <<: *dynamic-back

      description: >
        Two neighborhoods are connected by the production of goods.
        Labor disputes, material shortages, sabotage,

      prompts:
        - What is being made? Processed metals, medicines, tools?
        - How is it being used? By whom? For what?
        - Who wants these things? Who doesn't them to be made?

    front: &Political
      <<: *dynamic-front
      name: Political
      description: >
        Two neighborhoods interact via power, influence, and leadership.
        There is a long-standing arrangement or entrenched leadership
        keeping things stable. Enough people, or the right people,
        like things as they are and work to keep it that way.
      prompts:
        - Who benefits from the situation? Who suffers?
        - What keeps the relationship going?
        - How reluctant are people to acknowledge or confront the situation?
    back:
      <<: *dynamic-back
      name: Political
      description: >
        Two neighborhoods interact via influence, and leadership.
        One might dominate another, depend on another for legitimacy,
        or prioritize or ignore the other.
        When the corrupt edifice falls,
        who will be beneath it when it finally falls?
      prompts:
        - Who is agitating for change? Who holds the line?
        - What outside influences are present? Who do they support?
        - Is the struggle physically peaceful or violent?

      description: >
        Two neighborhoods play off each other via fashion or pop culture.
        The trends of the moment may shift between the two,
        or the tension between them may be what creates the magic.
        The results are disseminated through parties, performances, and gossip.
      prompts:
        - What's in fashion now? What is out now?
        - How is fashion expressed, e.g. clothes, jewelry, music, tattoos?
        - Who are the trendsetters? Who are the rebels?

        Two neighborhoods play off each other via fashion or pop culture.
        One may be trying to crush the other's creative efforts,
        or upstage the other in increasingly desperate ways.
        The results may be soulless, gaudy, or seen as needlessly aggressive.
      prompts:
        - What's in fashion now? What is out now?
        - How is fashion expressed, e.g. clothes, jewelry, music, tattoos?
