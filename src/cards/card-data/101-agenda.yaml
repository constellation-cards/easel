        During play, you can speak from one of several agendas.

        These agendas can be assigned individually to several people,
        or all given to a single player.

        The agendas can change hands during the game.
        You cannot take an agenda away from someone else,
        but you can ask someone else to give up an agenda.

        If you've been assigned an agenda, you are bound to speak from it.

      If you aren't sure what other agenda you should have,
      the Principal is probably what you want.
