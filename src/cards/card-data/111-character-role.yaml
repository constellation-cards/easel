      Role cards tell us what sort of story arcs surround your character.
      For example, a Soldier's story will be about the role of violence,
      while a Dreamer's story will be about the clash between their
      idealism and the reality they face.

      The flip side of a role card talks about the challenges and hazards
      your character faces on their journey.
