    description: >
      Upbringing cards talk about a character's backstory, but don't stop there.
      They describe how characters have learned to interact with other people,
      and how they see the world.

      The flip side of an Upbringing card is about the limitations of these visions.
      A character's prejudices, assumptions, and social shortcomings can come from
      their upbringing as well.

        Without experiencing what other people in your life
