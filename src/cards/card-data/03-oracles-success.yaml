      A Success Oracle gives you a success-or-fail
      outcome by drawing a random card.
      In a standard deck, there's an equal number of success and failure cards.
      You can tune the chances of success or failure by combining the cards
      in different proportions.

        You can choose to draw a card of this type
        to see if you meet a challenge.

        The card will suggest ways in which the challenge was met.
        You can use one of these, or make up your own.
        If a card indicates that you missed,
        you may not try to meet the challenge in other ways.

        You may adjust the ratio
        of hit or miss cards in this stack
        to reflect the difficulty of a given action.
