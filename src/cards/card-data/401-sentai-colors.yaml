      Color cards exemplify the archetypes of Super Sentai characters.
      Each character who bears a color has a relationship to its archetype.
      Some fulfill the archetype fully, while others subvert or transcend it.

      Color archetypes have positive qualities (bravery, cunning), but also
      negative traits and flaws.
