        "My daggers bounced off that plate mail! What now?" -- Basler
      description: >
        This encounter includes something important that is heavily defended.
        This could mean body armor of leather or metal,
        hardened barriers of stone, or wood,
        a protective aura of magic, a divine blessing,

      flavor: >
        "You know what metal does? Heats up. Fireball!" -- Tana
      description: >
        Every armor has a weakness or comes at a cost,
        like making someone slower or something heavier.
        Not every armor's weakness is obvious, and finding it may be difficult.
      prompts:
        - Those protected have limited mobility and senses
        - Weakness to specific damage types, e.g. lightning

        "That's a big castle..." -- Basler
      description: >
        A Base can be a temporary encampment, an outpost,
        a secret headquarters, a wild animal's den, or some other protected space.
        You might need to find something specific,
        get in or out, or confront the occupants.
      prompts:
        - Bases can have numerous occupants
        - Traps, labyrinthine structure, or other clever preparations

      name: Base
      flavor: >
        "The tyrant king doesn't know about these secret tunnels" -- Emory
      description: >
        While Bases can be big and imposing,
        their nature can work against their occupants.
        The bigger the Base, the more likely it is to hold something helpful.
      prompts:
        - Contain secrets about the plans and activities of its occupants
        - Hold resources, weapons, or captives
        - Include defensible choke points or hiding spots

      name: Diabolical
      flavor: >
        "Back, foul fiend! Light will overcome you!" -- Emory
      description: >
        A Diabolical encounter has the touch of evil.
        An actual summoned demon, a possessed victim,
        or a dark and malevolent force are all Diabolic.
      prompts:
        - Seek to corrupt or influence the vulnerable
        - Exploit moral weaknesses or dark secrets
        - Expose its true nature and hellish powers

      name: Diabolical
      flavor: >
        "Basler, stop cringing. He's not talking about you." -- Woody
      description: >
        Evil hasn't won, though it keeps trying.
        Powers from beyond are bound by their own rules too,
        and can be defeated accordingly.

        Characters who arm themselves with occult lore or
        divine blessings may circumvent or neutralize
        a Diabolical power.
      prompts:
        - Be susceptible to folk incantations or rituals
        - Recoil from the pure of heart

      <<: *tback
      name: Elemental
      flavor: >
        "They had some nice gemstones too!" -- Basler
      description: >
        Each element has rules. Water flows.
        Fire burns, but not without fuel.
        Some elements can counteract others.
        These rules can be exploited.
      prompts:
        - Be vulnerable to their element's normal vulnerabilities or rules
        - Require a nearby source of the element
  - front: &Flying
      <<: *tfront
      name: Flying
      flavor: >
        "Did something just swoop overhead?" -- Emory
      description: >
        This encounter includes something flying or airborne.
        Winged creatures, skilled magicians, and floating platforms

        "Meet my best girl, Annette! A net, get it?" -- Basler
      description: >

      prompts:
        - Become entangled, trapped, or confined in ways that negate flight

        "Sounds like fair odds to me. Have at you!" -- Emory
      description: >
        The strength of a gang is in its numbers.
        Without a strong leader, the gang obeys its collective impulses.
        Individual members can be isolated and confronted.
      prompts:
        - Have competing impulses or mixed sympathies or agendas
        - Fall apart if a leader is weakened or shamed

      <<: *tfront
      name: Hybrid

        "A Gryphon. The heraldic symbol of my kingdom. Majestic!" -- Emory
      description: >
        A Hybrid being is made up of two or more things, not always living.
        Such beings can be part-human (mermaids, harpies),

        "That thing was terrifying! Your kingdom is messed up!" -- Basler

        Not every hybrid has a perfect command of its own nature.
        Hybrids must also obey the rules of all their component parts.

        - Suffer the vulnerabilities of any of their contributing parts
        - Become confused by conflicting impulses or instincts

      <<: *tfront
      name: Large
      flavor: >
        "The bigger they are, the harder they fall!" -- Tana
      description: >
        This encounter includes something of enormous size.
        It might be naturally large, like a dragon or a giant,

      description: >
        You may have trouble engaging with a Large encounter
        due to the size difference, but that trouble goes both ways.
        It can be hard for Large things to perceive or target smaller
        foes.
      prompts:

      name: Monstrous
      flavor: >
        "That ain't no ordinary wolf, folks.." -- Basler
      description: >
        Monstrous threats are altered forms of the familiar.
        They are fiercer, more feral, or disturbingly unnatural,
        the nightmarishly distorted vision of the original.
      prompts:

        - Use their adaptions to overwhelm the unprepared
        - Terrify onlookers with their awful nature

      description: >

        fighting relentlessly when others would retreat.

        "That's Gretamaw, the Beaked Butcher!" -- Basler
      description: >
        A monster whispered of by fearful villagers. A lonely place of power.
        An artifact of legend, replete with arcane power.
        A person sung of by the bards.
        The weight of its reputation or its followers may be as much of a danger as its own power.

        - Dominate with their presence
        - Live up to the legend in a big way
        - Reveal an unexpected ability

      description: >
        The stories about this encounter might give you
        clues on how to deal with it. But stories are just that, stories.
        You might correctly leverage its lore,
        or look at it with fresh eyes and discover a truth the bards omitted.
      prompts:
        - Behave or react predictably
        - Be less, or other, than the stories say
        - Be part of another unguessed story

        The Portentous is the first step on a larger road.
        It both surprises characters, and prepares them for what is next.

      description: >
        Spectral beings are only visitors in the waking world.
        Their anchors are tenuous,

      description: >
        Venomous creatures, assassins with poisoned blades,

        "My arrows can fly farther than its spit." -- Woody
      description: >
        Some toxins have antidotes, or may not penetrate some
        kinds of defense.
        For example, a snake's fangs might be deflected by armor.
      prompts:
        - Inadvertently harm allies, or themselves if they are not immune
        - Be unable to deliver its poison if you find adequate protection
        - Fail to harm something or someone with a natural or acquired immunity
  - front: &Undead
      <<: *tfront
      name: Undead
      flavor: >
        "This unholy abomination will fall!" -- Emory
      description: >
        Necromancy, curses, or strange phenomena
        can bring a deceased creature back to a false life.
        The being is sustained by magic, not biology.
        Some undead are mindless; others are disturbingly cunning.

        - Frighten onlookers with a reminder of mortality

      name: Undead
      flavor: >
        "Not so much fell as fell apart..." -- Basler
      description: >
        Being sustained by dark magic, the undead are equally vulnerable to it.
        Many cannot abide holy objects, places, or effects.
        Others are bound by orders to only guard a certain place,
        or do a certain thing.
      prompts:
        - Weaken or expire in the presence of the sacred or the pure
        - Fall prey to tricks or traps a thinking being could avoid
        - Have limitations its creator didn't anticipate
