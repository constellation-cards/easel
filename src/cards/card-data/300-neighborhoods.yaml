      name: The Boulevard
      description: >
        A Boulevard is where the city's artistic and aesthetic
        offerings connect with individual citizens.
        Shops, eateries, arcades, and more offer visitors
        chances to spend money and time.
        A variety of sights, sounds, and smells
        attracts both tourists and locals.
      prompts:
        - What are some of the notable sights and attractions?
        - What sort of crowds come here?
        - Does the crowd change due to time of day, season, etc.?

        A Boulevard is where the city's artistic and aesthetic
        offerings connect with individual citizens.
        Right now, people aren't there.
        Whether it's fallen from former glories,
        or nurturing an unblossomed seed of new ambition,
        it's not giving people a reason to come.
      prompts:
        - How new is the Boulevard compared to the city overall?
        - How does its current state make people feel?
        - Is anyone trying to attract new visitors? To stop them?

      description: >
        A Harbor is the home of trade and travel.

      name: The Harbor
      description: >
        A Harbor is the home of trade and travel, to and from the city.
        It is often the last sight a regretful traveler sees before leaving.
        Commercial transports - caravans, trains, or zeppelins -
        are run down, neglected, or underutilized.
      prompts:
        - What modes of transportation are found here?
        - Are conditions poor because of the city, or something outside?

    front: &Marketplace
      <<: *neighborhood-front
      name: The Marketplace
      description: >
        The Marketplace is the commercial core of the city.
        It might include a rowdy labyrinth of vendors hawking their wares,
        a smoke-smothered block of forges and anvils where blacksmiths arm the soldiery,
        or warehouses full of grain or rice.
      prompts:
        - What goods is the neighborhood best known for?
        - What can be found here, but is unknown to most visitors?
        - Who controls what's found here?

        The Marketplace is the commercial core of the city.
        The vendors may be few and far between,
        the fires of the forge may lie extinguished,
        and farmers' crops may rot in warehouses - or be taken away at insultingly low prices.
      prompts:
        - Does the neighborhood have the wrong goods, or the wrong buyers?
        - What hidden assets might still be found here?
        - Who profits from the current situation? Who does not?

      <<: *neighborhood-front
      name: The Sanctuary
      description: >
        The Sanctuary is a city within the city.
        It might be a walled-off enclave, a culturally distinct community,
        a gentrified neighborhood, a historical relic, or something else.
        Its shops, home, and infrastructure are self-sufficient,
        and aesthetically or culturally unique.
      prompts:
        - Who lives here? Why do they live here specifically?
        - What separates the Sanctuary from the rest of the city?
        - What sustains the sanctuary and its peoples' lifestyles?

      <<: *neighborhood-back
      name: The Sanctuary
      description: >
        The Sanctuary is a city within the city.
        It might be an isolated enclave, a brow-beaten borough,
        a place to abandon the unwanted, or something else.
        A sanctuary can barely sustain its residents, whether due to lack of goods
        or intentional deprivation.
      prompts:
        - Who lives here? Why do they live in the Sanctuary specifically?
        - Is the Sanctuary keeping the outside out, or the inhabitants in?
        - Who rules here? Who suffers?

      name: The Temple
      description: >
        The Temple is devoted to the spiritual and religious elements of the city
        and its inhabitants. It might be a single colossal church,
        a network of holy places for every faith,
        or tiny shrines to tiny gods scattered across the city.
      prompts:
        - What belief systems exist?
        - Are beliefs or practices divided along social lines such as wealth, species, or neighborhood?
        - How has faith affected the city for good? For ill?

      name: The Temple
      description: >
        The Temple is devoted to the spiritual and religious elements of the city
        and its inhabitants.
        It might be a disgraced or amoral mega-church,
        a collection of squabbling rival churches,
        or the remnants of an older and forgotten belief system.
      prompts:
        - What belief system or systems were practiced here?
        - What motive, such as greed, corruption, or apathy, stands against them?
        - How has a lack of faith helped, or hurt?

      <<: *neighborhood-front
      name: The Underground
      description: >
        The Underground is what people don't see about the city.
        It might be literally underground, like sewers or burial chambers,
        or just necessary but boring infrastructure like aqueducts.
      prompts:
        - What vital services does the Underground provide?
        - How does the Underground physically connect with the rest of the city?
        - Who lives here, and what do they do?
    back:
      <<: *neighborhood-back
      name: The Underground
      description: >
        The Underground is what people don't want to see about the city.
        It is the filthy waterways and skull-strewn tombs.
        It has been abandoned or is being misused,
        and may be dangerous due to its inhabitants or simple neglect.
      prompts:
        - How much of the Underground still functions? What has broken down?
        - What social ills, like disease or poverty, have taken hold?

        It is home to the elite, including skilled creators,
        wealthy merchants, influential politicians, and beloved performers.
        Visitors might beseech an Uptown resident to fund their ventures,
        or seek their attention for some new idea or creation.
      prompts:
        - What political and social systems support the neighborhood's position?
        - How is power wielded here?
        - How does someone become accepted by Uptown?
    back:

      name: Uptown

        Uptown is the city's fallen crown.
        Bourgeoisie merchants with pretentions to greatness,
        shabby aristocrats fallen from favor,
        or forgotten influencers might all be found here,
        hunting for real power or comforting delusions.
      prompts:
        - What political or social systems once supported the neighborhood?
        - Do the inhabitants still believe they hold real power?
        - What will they do to get it back?

        The Warren is the hidden heart of the city.
        It is an organic tangle of alleyways, residences, nameless shops,
        side streets, historical buildings, and more.

      prompts:
        - What traditions or styles did the Warren give birth to?
        - What hidden treasures can be found here?
        - How do locals and visitors interact with each other?

        The Warren is the hidden heart of the city.
        It is an impenetrable maze of dark alleys, boarded-up shops,
        narrow streets, ancient graveyards, and more.
        It is the city's secret suffering.
      prompts:
        - Has the city forsaken itself, or fallen prey to outside influence?
        - What secrets do the inhabitants furtively guard?
        - Does the Warren bristle at visitors, or hunker down and wait for them to leave?
