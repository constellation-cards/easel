        description: >
          Frame cards let you quickly create a game to play,
          when nobody in the group has any strong ideas.
          They are like character cards for the game itself.

          Each player draws a random Frame card, or picks a specific one.
          They then make decisions based on those cards about what to play,
          and the group discusses what to make of all this.
          The cards are the start of a conversation, not the end of it -
          players can draw new cards, change their mind, etc.
        rule: Flip to see the specific Frame. Discard once play begins.
  - template: &rule Flip to see additional rules. Discard once play begins.

      name: Activity
      description: >
        An Activity is whatever the players will typically be doing during the game,
        at least at first.

        Individual characters could be well suited for the activity,
        but it's also interesting if they aren't, but must do it anyway.
      prompts:
        - Treasure hunting
        - Escaping powerful enemies
        - Rescuing people in need
        - Exploring mysteries

      name: Setting
      description: >
        This is the place & time the game takes place.
        The game doesn't have to stay here, but it should start here.

        Setting can come with cultural assumptions that players
        don't know (e.g. personal etiquette), or aren't comfortable with (e.g. racism).
        Make sure everyone is comfortable with playing in a proposed setting,
        and explain in detail what's important about the setting to you.
      prompts:
        - Edwardian London, 1905
        - A Wild West with dinosaurs
        - A mysterious space empire
        - The ancient past or a ruined future

      name: Perspective
      description: >
        Perspective is whose side of a conflict we're seeing.
        In a war between two sides, each side is a Perspective, but so
        are the innocent civilians caught in the middle,
        or the visitors from uninvolved nations trapped by the fighting.

        Not every player needs to play a member of the Perspective group,
        but that group is who the group will most often interact with.
      prompts:
        - Partisans and patriots in a conflict
        - Oppressed or neglected people
        - People uncovering or concealing a secret
        - Travelers experiencing local events

      name: Scope
      description: >
        Scope is the outer boundary of the game's action and conflicts.
        If you tell a story about WW2, the scope could be a single unit of soldiers,
        the entire Pacific conflict, the siege of a single city in the Ardennes,
        or anything in between.
      prompts:
        - A single town or city
        - A specific group of people
        - A trade route or geographic region
        - A whole world or planet

      name: Genre
      description: >
        Genre is any family of work connected in style or form.
        Genres come with expectations and tropes. For example,
        science fiction often comes with gadgets that save the day,
        while in horror it's common for devices like cars and phones to fail.

        Genre is like a lens that colors how we see a story.
        The same old cabin by the lake could play host to romance,
        horror, or mystery stories.
      prompts:
        - Action/Adventure
        - Mystery
        - Romance or Melodrama
        - Sci-fi or Fantasy

      name: Mood
      description: >
        Mood is the kind of emotion we want the game to elicit.
        Are we being silly? Are we being ultra-serious?
        Are we examining qualities of the world as observers,
        or do we want to immerse ourselves in the world as inhabitants?
      prompts:
        - Cheerful vs. Somber
        - Nostalgic vs. Progressive
        - Optimistic vs. Pessimistic
        - Serious vs. Comedic

      name: Inspiration
      description: >
        This is a game based on a specific work, such as Star Wars,
        Lord of the Rings, Gideon the Ninth, etc.
        If you are basing a game on works that not every player knows,
        either be prepared to answer questions,
        or accept that some players may take the game in directions
        the original work didn't go.
      prompts:
        - What parts of the work do you want to bring in?
        - What parts do you not care about?
        - Which players know the inspiration vs. which don't?
        - What do you feel should be changed about the work? What shouldn't?

      name: Pole Stars
      description: >
        A "Pole Star" is an in-game element (e.g. dragons) or a general topic (e.g. war)
        that you want the game to be about.
        The most interesting Pole Star games will have characters who all have
        different attitudes about the thing,
        but who have motives to work together despite their differences.
      prompts:
        - A fictional element you like (dragons, magic, time travel)
        - An important personal or social topic (crime, poverty)
        - A contentious event (the coronation of an unpopular ruler)
        - A moral or ethical concept (responding to tyranny)
      rule: *rule
