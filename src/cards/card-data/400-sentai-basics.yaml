        The Team starts with an Arsenal: Personal Weapons, Team Bazooka,
        Combining Mecha, and Red Powerup. Each of these items starts
        the game with a 1 Star Rating. Ratings are team-wide,
        even for Personal Weapons.

        After each story arc, raise the Star Rating of one Arsenal item
        by 1, with no upper limit.

        Rules that say "inflict Star Damage" mean to use the Star Rating
        of the Arsenal item that was used in the attack.

        The team has 2 Stars in Personal Weapons.
        If the Red Ranger attacks a mob of minions,
        they do 2 Stars worth of damage.

        If the team must combine their mecha to fight a giant enemy,
        they'd inflict damage based on their Combining Mecha rating.
